## Copy This Repository

> **Tip:** Links below navigate away from this page. **Ctrl + click** (or right-click → *Open in new tab*) to keep this ReadMe visible while you work.

1. Go to [**GitHub Importer**](https://github.com/new/import)
2. Under **The URL for your source repository**, enter: `https://github.com/ShadowAISolutions/autoupdatehtmltemplate`
3. Choose your **repository name**
4. Click the green **Begin import** button

## Initialize This Template

> **Important:** The links in steps 1 and 2 below point to the settings of **whichever repo you are viewing this page from**. Make sure you are reading this on **your own copy** of the repository, not on the original template repo — otherwise the links will lead to a 404 page.

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages

Go to your repository's [**Pages settings**](../../settings/pages) and configure:

- **Source**: Select **GitHub Actions** (not "Deploy from a branch")

  This allows the included workflow to deploy your `live-site-pages/` directory automatically.

### 2. Configure the `github-pages` Environment

Go to your repository's [**Environments settings**](../../settings/environments), click into the `github-pages` environment, and:

- Select the dropdown next to the **Deployment branches and tags** heading and choose **No restriction**

### 3. Run Claude Code and Type `initialize`

> The initialization process takes approximately **~8 minutes** from when you send `initialize` to when Claude has finished all its actions.

Open the repo with Claude Code and type **`initialize`** as your first prompt. Claude will automatically:

&emsp;Detect your new repo name and org<br>
&emsp;Update all references throughout the codebase<br>
&emsp;Replace the placeholder text above with your live site link<br>
&emsp;Commit and push — triggering the workflow to deploy to GitHub Pages

Your site will be live at `https://<your-org>.github.io/<your-repo>/`

## How It Works

### Auto-Refresh via Version Polling
Every hosted page polls a lightweight `.version.txt` file every 10 seconds. When a new version is deployed, the page detects the mismatch and auto-reloads — showing a green "Website Ready" splash with audio feedback.

### CI/CD Auto-Merge Flow
1. Push to a `claude/*` branch
2. GitHub Actions automatically merges into `main`, deploys to GitHub Pages, and cleans up the branch
3. No pull requests needed — the workflow handles everything

### GAS Embedding Architecture
Google Apps Script projects are embedded as iframes in GitHub Pages. The framework handles:

&emsp;Automatic GAS deployment via `doPost` when `.gs` files change<br>
&emsp;"Code Ready" blue splash on GAS updates (client-side polling)<br>
&emsp;Google Sign-In from the parent page (stable OAuth origin)
